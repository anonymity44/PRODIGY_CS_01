Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt text based on a shift value. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting the letters of the input text by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

**Features:**
Encryption: Users can input a message and a shift value to encrypt their text.
Decryption: Encrypted text can be decrypted by using the same shift value.

**Usage:**
Run the script.
Input the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter the shift value (positive for right shift, negative for left shift).
